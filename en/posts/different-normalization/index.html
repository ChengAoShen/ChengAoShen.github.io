Normalization techniques are fundamental to training deep learning models effectively. They help stabilize and accelerate training, improve generalization, and prevent internal covariate shift. Below is a summary of the most common normalization techniques, their mechanisms, key papers, and differences.

          Weakness
      
  
  
      
          Batch Normalization (BN)
          For Conv: per channel across B×H×W; For MLP: per feature across B.
          Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift (ICML 2015)
          Computer Vision Field like Image Classification, Detection, Segmentation
          Stabilizes activation scale; Enables larger learning rates, Speeds convergence;  Adds implicit regularization
          Less suited to online / streaming / RNN small-batch settings, can cause issues in domain shift or micro-batch training
      
      
          Layer Normalization (LN)
          Per sample (token) across its feature (hidden) dimensions (e.g. For shape B×L×D or B×D: normalize over D; for Conv rarely used, would be over C×H×W of that sample)
          Layer Normalization (arXiv 2016)
          Transformers (NLP &amp; Vision), RNNs, small-batch or batch=1 training
          Independent of batch size, identical behavior in training &amp; inference, stable for variable-length sequences, improves gradient flow (esp. Pre-LN Transformers)
          Provides less implicit regularization, does not leverage cross-sample statistics
      
      
          Instance Normalization (IN)
          For conv input BxCxHxW: each sample &amp; channel independently over its spatial pixels HxW (no cross-batch, no cross-channel).
          Instance Normalization: The Missing Ingredient for Fast Stylization (ECCV 2016)
          image generation (GAN generators), image-to-image translation (e.g., style/appearance adaptation)
          Batch size–independent, effectively strips instance-specific style (contrast, color cast), aiding fast stylization
          Discards global intensity/contrast cues useful for recognition → poorer performance on classification/detection; lacks batch-level regularization
      
      
          Group Normalization (GN)
          For input BxCxHxW: per sample, split channels into G groups (size C/G); compute mean &amp; var over (C/G)xHxW inside each group.
          Group Normalization (ECCV 2018)
          Small-/micro-batch CNN training, cases where BN fails with batch sizes 1–4.
          Batch-size independent; stable for tiny or variable batches; often better than BN when batch is very small.
          Extra hyperparameter (G) to tune; less implicit regularization than BN, grouping may not align with the semantic channel structure
      
      
          Weight Normalization (WN)
          Each weight vector of a neuron/output channel.
          Weight Normalization: A Simple Reparameterization to Accelerate Training of Deep Neural Networks (NIPS 2016)
          RNN / seq models where BN is hard, small-batch or online / RL training (policy &amp; value nets)
          Negligible inference cost (can fold into static weights); works with streaming / RL; complements other norms (can combine with LayerNorm)
          Scale may drift (need LR tuning); benefit can vanish with strong adaptive optimizers; less helpful for very deep Transformers (other norms preferred)
      
      
          Spectral Normalization (SN)
          Each weight tensor (e.g. matrix / conv kernel reshaped to 2D)
          Spectral Normalization for Generative Adversarial Networks (ICLR 2018)
          GAN discriminators, robustness / Lipschitz-constrained models, etc.
          Enforces (approx.) 1-Lipschitz per layer (controls gradient explosion)
          Extra cost (power iteration each step); only constrains the largest singular value (other singular values can still drift)
      
      
          RMS Normalization
          Per sample (token) feature vector
          Root Mean Square Layer Normalization (NIPS 2019)
          Modern Transformer / LLM blocks;  very deep pre-norm architectures, low-precision (FP16/BF16)
          Simpler &amp; slightly cheaper than LayerNorm, numerically stable in mixed precision, good for very deep stacks (retains strong gradient path)
          Mean not zeroer,  possible drift, needs careful init/residual scaling, and isn’t fully interchangeable with zero-mean LN methods.

$$<ul>
<li>
<p>Why separate the Channel dimension during calculating the $\mu, \sigma$?</p>
<p>The Channel usually represent the different feature of the sample, such as color, texture, which shouldn’t be normalized together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why cross different sample in the batch?</p>
<ol>
<li>Using $B\times H\times W$ numbers gives a smoother (less noisy) mean and variance.</li>
<li>Remove sample-level shift.</li>
<li>Add noice between different batch as regulation</li>

  <strong>Layer Normalization (LN)</strong>

<p>The Layer Normalization normally used in NLP field. Generally, the input shape will look like $\text{Batch}(B)\times \text{Length}(L) \times \text{Token}(D)$.</p>
$$
\mu_{b,l} = \frac{1}{D}\sum_{d=1}^{D} x_{b,l,d}
$$$$
\sigma_{b,l}^{2} = \frac{1}{D}\sum_{d=1}^{D} (x_{b,l,d}-\mu_{b,l})^{2}
$$$$
\hat{x}_{b,l} = \frac{x_{b,l}-\mu_{b,l}}{\sqrt{\sigma_{b,l}^2+\varepsilon}}
$$$$
y_{b,l} = \gamma_{d}\,\hat{x}_{b,l} + \beta_{d}
$$<ul>
<li>
<p>Why not treat the sequence length L as part of the feature dimension?</p>
<p>Because in NLP the feature (channel) dimension is in the hidden size $D$; positions along L are <strong>different tokens</strong>, not different feature subspaces of the same token. Channels describe aspects of one token; sequence positions index different tokens. Mixing over $L$ would entangle token-specific information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why use Pre-LN?</p>
<p>Pre-LN moved LN <em>before</em> each sublayer so that residual additions remain pure identity shortcuts, dramatically improving gradient flow and training stability—critical for very deep or large Transformers—at the cost of needing a final normalization and sometimes explicit residual scaling to control activation growth.</p>

$$<ul>
<li>
<p>What different Between Layer Normalization and Instance Normalization?</p>
<p>Also they look like both deal with the last channel, but actually LayerNorm (LN) normalizes the entire feature vector / channel set of a single sample together; InstanceNorm (IN) normalizes each channel’s spatial dimensions of the same sample separately (without mixing channels).</p>

<p>This post is a quick field guide to seven of the most widely used normalization methods in deep learning—BatchNorm, LayerNorm, InstanceNorm, GroupNorm, WeightNorm, Spectral Norm, and RMS Norm. For each, it explains <strong>what is being normalized, how it’s computed (with key formulas), where it first appeared, and the typical scenarios in which it shines or struggles</strong>. By contrasting their underlying statistics (batch-level vs. sample-level, feature-wise vs. weight-wise) and listing practical pros / cons, the blog equips researchers and practitioners to choose the right normalizer for everything from tiny-batch CNNs to giant Transformer stacks, GANs, and reinforcement-learning agents.</p>
